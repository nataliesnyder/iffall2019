<li>Justification: the justification looks weird, especially since nothing else on the page is justified. Fix the trackimng, or maybe don't justify it at all.</li>
<li>Title Text: the name of the recipe is hard to read over the image. Using a color found in the image hurts the legibility. Either change the color or move the text off of the image.</li>
<li>Numbers: the step numbers are too close to the content, adjust the padding to give it more space.</li>

<li>Bold: the bolding in the recipe steps is a little confusing, why are certain instructions highlighted but others aren't?</li>
<li>Title Text: the title text is hard to read.</li>
<li>Justification: the tracking in the justified text is weird, fisx it or get rid if the justification. Why is it the only place where it shows up?</li>
<li>Yeild: Move yield information down, feels out of place after main description.</li>
