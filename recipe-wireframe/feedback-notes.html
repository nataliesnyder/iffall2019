	Jefferson gave me feeback in class today (thank you Jefferson). This is the gist of what he said: <br><br>

	<ol>
		
		<li>
			<b>Remember the mobile layout!</b> I think my wireframe was a little wide, making it look like I have more space than I actually do. Moving forward, I'll make sure to limit my page width to simulate the actual device the recipe will be used on.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Increase font size.</b> I guess this is where designing for the printed page came in and tripped me up, because I set my body text as 14pt and though it was way too large. Not. The. Case. Jefferson recommended that I increase it even more, maybe to 17pt for the body. This means I'm going to have to adjust the rest of my text as well.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>More hierarchy in the list of steps.</b> Yet another good peice of feedback from Jefferson! He suggested that I bold or color the most important part of the recipe steps.

		</li>
		<li>
			
			<b>An ending.</b> This recipe should probably have a definitive ending. A congratulations, perhaps, or at least a final image. I'll write a little something-something 
		</li>
		<li>
			
			<b>More pictures.</b> The big one! All but one of the pictures of this recipe available online look <i>disgusting</i>, but it would be helpful to have images to accompany the instructions. To fix this problem, I will make the recipe and take my own pictures to use for the webpage.

		</li>
	</ol>
