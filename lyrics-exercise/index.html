			<p class="first-paragraph" id="paragraph1"><br>The name of every landlord is displayed out on the awnings</br>
			<br>And the farmer in the amber fields were harmonized in yawning</br>
			<br>As the memory of the ghost hung at the exit</br>
			<br>And the city doctor called in feeling head sick</br></p>

			<p class="second-paragraph" id="paragraph2"><br>All the freedom-founding fathers</br>
			<br>Altogether speak too soon</br>
			<br>The sounds that mutter underneath</br>
			<br>The glowing, Greek blue moon</br>
			<br>As tide rolls up beyond the walking trail</br>
			<br>So don't have the native every mocking gale</br>
			<br style= "color: white;">React to it at your leisure, modern pressure</br></p>

			<p class="third-paragraph" id="paragraph3"><br>All the street were filled with carbon</br>
			<br>And a pack of trembling dogs</br>
			<br>The weather comes in from the east spills a Kremlin fog</br>
			<br>As they fill the holes of every open tomb</br>
			<br>In the factories of dirty broken looms</br></p>

			<p class="fourth-paragraph" id="paragraph4"><br>The sky was open wide</br>
			<br>And it was pouring civil war</br>
			<br>The body that you carry was comprised of simple lore</br>
			<br>Where the iceman at the cinema floats anagrams</br>
			<br>No no one could go past your little diaphrams</br>
			<br style= "color: white;">The stillness of the changing weather, modern pressure</br></p>


			<p class="fifth-paragraph" id="paragraph5"><br>That oasis sometimes lingers like a patch of blackened ice</br>
			<br>The sellers of the row tap and locked and packed in twice</br>
			<br>Only names are what remain to label you</br>
			<br>Where I heard the praise of sex and table food</br>
			<br>Up beyond the sunrise waits another pounding storm</br>
			<br>Somewhere from the rubble sounds of nothing sounding born</br></p>

			<p class="sixth-paragraph" id="paragraph6"><br>At the zero grounds of future battle sites</br>
			<br>While the gods still fill our heads with satellites</br>
			<br style= "color: white;">Take the seeds my holy thresher, modern pressure</br></p>
