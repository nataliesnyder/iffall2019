		<h1>MODERN PRESSURE</h1>
		

		

				<div>

			

			
	
			<p class="first-paragraph" id="paragraph1"><br>The name of every landlord is displayed out on the 
				<em>awnings</em></br>
			<br>And the farmer in the amber fields were harmonized in <em>yawning</em></br>
			<br>As the memory of the ghost hung at <strong>the exit</strong></br>
			<br>And the city doctor called in feeling <strong>head sick</strong></br></p>

			<p class="second-paragraph" id="paragraph2"><br>All the freedom-founding fathers</br>
			<br>Altogether speak <em>too soon</em></br>
			<br>The sounds that mutter underneath</br>
			<br>The glowing, Greek <em>blue moon</em></br>
			<br>As tide rolls up beyond <strong>the walking trail</strong></br>
			<br>So don't have the native every <strong>mocking gale</strong></br>
			<br>React to it at your leisure, modern pressure</br></p>

			<p class="third-paragraph" id="paragraph3"><br>All the street were filled with carbon</br>
			<br>And a pack of <em>trembling dogs</em></br>
			<br>The weather comes in from the east spills a <em>Kremlin fog</em></br>
			<br>As they fill the holes of every <strong>open tomb</strong></br>
			<br>In the factories of dirty <strong>broken looms</strong></br></p>

			<p class="fourth-paragraph" id="paragraph4"><br>The sky was open wide</br>
			<br>And it was pouring <em>civil war</em></br>
			<br>The body that you carry was comprised of <em>simple lore</em></br>
			<br>Where the iceman at the cinema floats <strong>anagrams</strong></br>
			<br>No no one could go past your little <strong>diaphrams</strong></br>
			<br >The stillness of the changing weather, modern pressure</br></p>


			<p class="fifth-paragraph" id="paragraph5"><br>That oasis sometimes lingers like a <em>patch of blackened ice</em></br>
			<br>The sellers of the row tap and locked and <em>packed in twice</em></br>
			<br>Only names are what remain <strong>to label you</strong></br>
			<br>Where I heard the praise of sex and <strong>table food</strong></br>
			<br>Up beyond the sunrise waits <em>another pounding storm</em></br>
			<br>Somewhere from the rubble sounds <em>of nothing sounding born</em></br></p>

			<p class="sixth-paragraph" id="paragraph6"><br>At the zero grounds of future <strong>battle sites</strong></br>
			<br>While the gods still fill our heads with <strong>satellites</strong></br>
			<br style= "color: white;">Take the seeds my holy thresher, modern pressure</br></p>
