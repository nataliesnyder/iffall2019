	<h1>Feedback for Ciara Greene</h1>

<ol>

<li>Text size on the mobile postcards could be increased</li>
<li>Type set awkwardly on third desktop, look at hyphen and consider moving <i>are</i> down</li>
<li>Introduce more typefaces? Could use more hierarchy between quote and speaker.
	A more common paragraph typeface could highlight the qualities of the display type. The inbterest of the display type gets lost when it is the only typeface on the page. </li>
<li>Gray/black out background on third image, high contrast white distracts from text.</li>
<li>Second image cropped in strange place, action unclear and focal point removed. What is imortant in this image?
Could also fully crop Gandalfâ€™s eye out, make it a more even split.</li>
<li>Mobiles could use more negative space around text (especially last two)</li>
<li>Adjust the contrast on Gandalf? Looks a little disconnected from the other two since they have such high contrast. 
	Or you could lean into the gray more and find a way to incorporate it into the type treatment. The gray of Gandalf is a little warm, it would be interesting to see some of that warmth carried into the text.</li>
<li>Move type on third mobile image down, maybe make it level with the subject's eyes? Could also make image smaller, give  room for larger text.</li>
</ol>
