			<h1>Natalie Snyder<br> Demonstration of Type Stylings</h1>
			<div class="crimson">Crimson Text</div>

			<p>The typeface I am using is called Crimson Text<br>
			A sample size– what you are reading right now!– is 20px<br>
			The sample text I am using is:<br>

			<i>“I was once told that there were only two men in my life: Jesus and Dracula. Shh! Now there's a third.”</i>
			<br>Please note that this line is not of my own creation, but from a blog called Seeker of Truth, run by artist and writer Wendy Brydge. I encourage you to <a href="https://wendylovesjesus.wordpress.com/about">explore her world.</a></p>
